## Log variable name and value: the short way

I found a very interesting article on [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/console-log-myvariable/) to log a variable in JS console.

 ```javascript
// my old-fashioned way
console.log("myVariable: ", myVariable);

// the much cooler way ðŸ˜Ž
console.log({ myVariable });
 ```

This works because the shorthand assignment for objects expects the variable name is equal to the object key.
In JS the example is interpreted as:

```javascript
{ 
  "myVariable": myVariable
}
```
